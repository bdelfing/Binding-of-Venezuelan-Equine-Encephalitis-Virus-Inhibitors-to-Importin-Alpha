These zip files contain pdb format files with the data used in clustering for each of the ligand systems. 

They include 10,000 structures per system (2,500 per trajectory), taken at evenly spaced intervals from the equilibrated data sets. Due to spacial limitations, the systems posted here are abbreviated versions, including only what was necessary for clustering: sidechain heavy atoms from minNLS binding site residues (used to align structures) and all ligand heavy atoms.
